# Team4.BACKEND

## E-Commerce Portal:

A full-stack user-centric application that allows a user to browse a database of products and make purchases. Users can create a new account or log-in to an existing account, browse products, add products to their cart, and checkout with their order. The application is cloud hosted, and utilizes the Smarty Streets API to verify user delivery addresses.

## Team Members:

- Alex Piccolo
- Ethan Catania
- Jude Hoekstra
- Vamsi Gurram

## Technologies Used

- C# (Backend programming language)
- EF Core (ORM)
- SQL Server (Azure hosted)
- ASP.NET Core (Web API Framework)
- xUnit/Moq (Backend Testing)
- Azure App Service (for application hosting)
- React as front end

## MVP:

    1. User should be able to login. Simple authentication.
    2. User Should be able to create a new account.
    3. After account verification, user should hit home page complete with a Top Navigation Bar to display different departments.
        a. By default, we list all items in main Window frame.
        b. Menu --> drop down list (categories), Cart --> Congregate orders and allow users to checkout.
    3. User should be able to select a department to display the list of products and their inventory count and price.
    4. User should be able to select an item and add that item to the cart for checkout.
        a. If inventory count <=0, then we should display "Out of stock". Display "Out of Stock" Label.
    5. User should be able to select their cart to see which items they have added to it.
    6. User should be able to modify the quantity of items in their cart.
    7. User should be able to delete items from their cart.
    8. User should be able to checkout with their selected items and input an address to ship the items to.
        a. Once checkout is completed, display message that items will be shipped via Courier.
        b. While checking out, use the 3rd party API, to check if Postal address is correct or NOT.

## External API:

- When Users type the Postall Address, we will use external API, to validate if address is correct or NOT.
